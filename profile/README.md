# About Us

We are two people dedicated to making high quality<sup>_[citation needed]_</sup> projects out of our passion for ~~suffering~~ development. Hope you can get some enjoyment out of our work!

## Members

^-^ Trevor - "Living proof you don't need to smart to code"

DaNub - "Touching grass is a sin and quarantine is a dream, not commenting is my thing and my code will make you scream" (yes this is intentionally cringe deal with it)

## Our Drive

We make our projects out of a drive to contribute to the open source community and to provide some entertainment for the people who use them. This also serves as a motivation for us to learn, improve, gain experience on programming.
